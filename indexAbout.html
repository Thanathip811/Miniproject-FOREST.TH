            <ul>Forests can occur wherever the temperatures rise above 10 째C (50 째F) in the warmest months and the annual precipitation is more than 200 mm (8 inches). </ul>
            <ul>They can develop under a variety of conditions within these climatic limits, and the kind of soil, plant, and animal life differs according to the extremes of environmental influences. </ul>
            <ul>In cool high-latitude subpolar regions, forests are dominated by hardy conifers such as pines (Pinus), spruces (Picea), and larches (Larix). </ul>
            <ul>In the Northern Hemisphere, these forests, called taiga, or boreal forests, have prolonged winters and between 250 and 500 mm (10 and 20 inches) of rainfall annually. </ul>
            <ul>Coniferous forests also cover mountains in many temperate parts of the world. </ul>
            <ul>In more temperate high-latitude climates, mixed forests of both conifers and broad-leaved deciduous trees predominate. </ul>
            <ul>Broad-leaved deciduous forests develop in middle-latitude climates, where there is an average temperature above 10 째C (50 째F) </ul>
            <ul>for at least six months every year and annual precipitation is above 400 mm (16 inches). </ul>
            <ul>A growing period of 100 to 200 days allows deciduous forests to be dominated by oaks (Quercus), elms (Ulmus), birches (Betula), maples (Acer), beeches (Fagus), and aspens (Populus). </ul>
            <ul>In the humid climates of the equatorial belt are tropical rainforests, which support incredible plant and animal biodiversity. </ul>
            <ul>There heavy rainfall supports evergreens that have broad leaves instead of needle leaves, as in cooler forests. Monsoon forests, which are the deciduous forests of tropical areas, are found in regions with a long dry season followed by an intense rainy season. In the lower latitudes of the Southern Hemisphere, the temperate deciduous forest reappears.</ul>
            <ul>Forest types are distinguished from each other according to species composition (which develops in part according to the age of the forest), the density of tree cover, type of soils found there, and the geologic history of the forest region. Altitude and unique meteorological conditions can also shape forest development (see cloud forest and elfin woodland).</ul>
